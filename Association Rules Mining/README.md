# Association Rules Mining with PyCaret

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating association rules mining using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.

## Assignment Overview

This project is part of a larger assignment to explore various machine learning tasks using PyCaret. The main objectives are:

1. Clone and successfully execute the PyCaret example notebooks in our own environment.
2. Create a video tutorial explaining each notebook's functionality (1 minute per notebook).
3. Organize the GitHub directory with proper README files.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook in this directory covers:

- Setting up PyCaret for association rules mining
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset (different from the official PyCaret examples)
- Applying association rules mining algorithms
- Analyzing and interpreting the results

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have PyCaret installed (`pip install pycaret==2.3.5`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Run the cells sequentially

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is [DATASET_NAME] from [SOURCE]. It was chosen to demonstrate association rules mining on [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA].

## Video Tutorial

A comprehensive video tutorial explaining this notebook and its outputs is available at [LINK_TO_VIDEO].

## Additional Notes

- This implementation uses full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for association rules mining.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
