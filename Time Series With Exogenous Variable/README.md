# Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables using PyCaret

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating time series forecasting with exogenous variables using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.

## Assignment Overview

This project is part of a larger assignment to explore various machine learning tasks using PyCaret. The main objectives are:

1. Clone and successfully execute the PyCaret example notebooks in our own environment.
2. Create a video tutorial explaining each notebook's functionality (1 minute per notebook).
3. Organize the GitHub directory with proper README files.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook in this directory covers:

- Setting up PyCaret for time series forecasting
- Loading and preprocessing a time series dataset with exogenous variables (different from the official PyCaret examples)
- Training and comparing multiple time series forecasting models
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Making future predictions

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have PyCaret installed (`pip install pycaret`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Run the cells sequentially

Note: The notebook is set up to use GPU if available (`use_gpu=True` in the setup function).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is [DATASET_NAME] from [SOURCE]. It was chosen to demonstrate time series forecasting with exogenous variables on [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA].

## Video Tutorial

A comprehensive video tutorial explaining this notebook and its outputs is available at [LINK_TO_VIDEO].

## Additional Notes

- This implementation uses full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for time series forecasting with exogenous variables.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
